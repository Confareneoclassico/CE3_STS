    "The test statistic for the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is W, defined as the smaller of **$W^+$** (sum of the positive ranks) and **$W^-$** (sum of the negative ranks). If the null hypothesis is true, we expect to see similar numbers of lower and higher ranks that are both positive and negative (i.e., W+ and W- would be similar). If the research hypothesis is true we expect to see more higher and positive ranks (in this example, more children with substantial improvement in repetitive behavior after treatment as compared to before, i.e., W+ much larger than W-).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, **$W^+$ = 32** and **$W^-$ = 4**. Recall that the sum of the ranks (ignoring the signs) will always equal n(n+1)/2. As a check on our assignment of ranks, we have n(n+1)/2 = 8(9)/2 = 36 which is equal to 32+4. The test statistic is W = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we must determine whether the observed test statistic W supports the null or research hypothesis. This is done following the same approach used in parametric testing. Specifically, we determine a critical value of W such that if the observed value of W is less than or equal to the critical value, we reject H0 in favor of H1, and if the observed value of W exceeds the critical value, we do not reject H0."
